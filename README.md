#Mod11-Lesson-4-Assignment-1

Description:In this project, I developed a React application utilizing React Router for dynamic routing. The `NavigationBar` component offers links to the homepage, character browsing, and comics sections. The `BrowseCharacters` component fetches and displays a list of Marvel characters, each linked to its respective details page using dynamic routes. The `CharacterDetail` component retrieves and displays detailed information about a selected character based on the character ID from the URL. The routing paths are defined as follows:

- `/`: HomePage
- `/characters`: Character Browsing
- `/character/:characterId`: Character Details
- `/comics`: Comics

This setup enables seamless navigation between different sections of the application.
